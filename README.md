#### NHL predictions project
---
This is  project for the subject Data Processing in Python - JEM207. That was created by Pavlína Křenková and Vojtěch Vaverka.

The code we wrote scrapes data from the website https://nhl.cz/. After the data is scraped, user of the code needs to fill in names of two teams into the variables *team_1* and *team_2*. Once those two variables are set the code creates a Logistic regression that predicts which team is going to win. Druing our testing of the code we have reached accuracy above 50%. That means that the model is better than randomly guessing. Yet it should not be used to place bets.
